                    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>
                        From centuries past, the sea has always been important to all and shipping plays
                        a crucial role being the backbone of world trade and economy. Underlying this is
                        the fact that 95% of the country international trade is carried in whole or in part
                        by maritime transport.
                        Though the ocean shipping industry, which transports 90 percent of what we own,
                        contributes approximately 3 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change,
                        sea and land acidification, and poor air quality. The industry also affects the oceans’ environmental health
                        through chemical cargo residues, cleaning agents, and nonindigenous species from ballast water.

                    <h3>ISSUES</h3>
                    <p>
                        The shipping operation generates many environmental pollutants that harm
                        the air and oceans. It daily produce sludge, bilge water, garbage, sewage
                        and harmful the ecosystem by the ballast water exchange operation. Through
                        this, we aim at identifying and quantifying these issues and to assess their
                        impact on the marine environment-the major of which includes air pollution,
                        oil spills, ballast water discharge and underwater noise.

                        Oil Spils
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Oil spills caused by damaged tankers, pipelines, or offshore oil rigs often result in
                        immediate and long-term environmental damage that can last for decades. These are among
                        the most notable areas of environmental damage caused by spills When an oil slick from a large spill reaches a beach, oil coats and clings to
                        every rock and grain of sand. If the oil washes into coastal marshes,mangrove forests,
                        or other wetlands, fibrous plants and grasses absorb oil, which can damage plants and make
                        the area unsuitable as wildlife habitat<span id="dots1"></span>
                        <span id="more1">Despite massive clean-up efforts following the 1989
                            Exxon Valdez oil spill, for example, a study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                            Administration (NOAA) found that 26,000 gallons of oil were still trapped in the sand along the
                            Alaska shoreline.
                            Even a small amount of oil can be deadly to a bird. By coating feathers, oil not only makes
                            flying impossible but also destroys birds' natural waterproofing and insulation, leaving them
                            vulnerable to hypothermia or overheating.As birds frantically preen their feathers to restore
                            their natural protections, they often swallow oil, which can severely damage their internal organs
                            and lead to death. The best estimate of the Exxon Valdez oil spill is that it killed 250,000 seabirds.
                            Oil spills frequently kill marine mammals such as whales, dolphins, seals, and sea otters.
                            10 Oil can clog blowholes of whales and dolphins, making it impossible for them to breathe properly
                            and disrupting their ability to communicate. Oil coats the fur of otters and seals, leaving them
                            vulnerable to hypothermia.

                        Underwater noise
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Oceans have always been noisy environments due to natural ambient underwater noise
                        from waves, vocalizations from marine mammals, and other marine species. Underwater
                        ocean ambient noise levels have increased by ~ 15 dB in the past 50 years due to increased
                        marine transportation including goods and other services, resource extraction, fishing, and other
                        anthropogenic sources. Man-made noise differs from ambient underwater noise with respect
                        to direction, frequency, and duration<span id="dots2"></span>
                        <span id="more2">Underwater noise has become increasingly important due to the nature of sound
                            propagation traveling approximately five times faster in water than air and the wide range
                            of detrimental effects to marine species. Until recently, the focus was aimed at marine mammals,
                            but it is now acknowledged that underwater noise can significantly impact fish and other marine
                            organisms. Commercial shipping is the source of low frequency, (i.e., 5–500 Hz), background noise
                            in the world’s oceans. Underwater noise pollution can significantly impact marine life even over
                            long distances. Impacts of underwater noise depend on duration and intensity. For example, the effects of long-term low-intensity noise, from marine vessels, can have greater negative effects on species than short-term large bursts of noise, such as underwater explosions,</span>.

                    <p>
                        Ballast water is fresh or saltwater held in the ballast tanks and cargo holds of ships.
                        It is used to provide stability and maneuverability during a voyage when ships are not
                        carrying cargo, not carrying heavy enough cargo,or when more stability is required due
                        to rough seas.The establishment of AIS can have significant economic, ecological,
                        and human health impacts.The introduction of the Comb Jelly (Mnemiopsis leidyi)
                        into the Black and Azov Seas is thought to have caused significant declines in the
                        commercial anchovy fisheries with estimated losses of $16.8 million. Ballast water has
                        also been associated with the spread of epidemic cholera from South America to
                        USA<span id="dots3"></span>
                        <span id="more3"> The European green crab (Carcinus maenus), zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), and
                            Chinese mitten crab (Eiocheir sinensis) are a subset of the well-studied AIS that have been spread
                            via ballast water. Propagule pressure, which describes the quantity of individuals released, and the
                            release events of AIS has been increasing, as the reliance on marine transport of goods continues to
                            grow. The Arctic is of concern, due to climate change, but new shipping routes through the Arctic
                            present themselves as sea ice melts, which is increasing propagule pressure via ballast water due
                            to potential increases in shipping traffic. Management of ballast water therefore
                            requires significant attention in the Arctic, as it becomes more susceptible to invasive species.
                            Propagule pressure is not only increasing in the Arctic, but globally as well. Management strategies
                            are aimed at reducing propagule pressure, which
                            is thought of as the primary method of decreasing the potential of AIS invasion.

                        Air Pollution
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Marine shipping-derived air pollution impacts environmental and human health.
                        Marine transportation accounts for 33% of all trade-related emissions from fossil
                        fuel combustion, including 3.3% of global carbon dioxide (CO2). Emissions depend
                        on the type of fuel, engine, and engine efficiency. Fuels include marine diesel oil
                        (MDO), marine fuel oil (MFO), and heavy fuel oil (HFO). While difficult to quantify,
                        marine shipping emissions have increased over the last 50 years. GHGs and conventional
                        pollutants contribute to the greenhouse effect and are primarily derived from fuel combustion<span id="dots4"></span>
                        <span id="more4">Air pollution from ships is generated by diesel engines that
                            burn high sulfur content fuel oil, also known as bunker oil, producing sulfur
                            dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulate, in addition to carbon monoxide,
                            carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons which again leads to the formation of aerosols
                            and secondary chemicals reactions including formations of HCHO, Ozone etc. in the
                            atmosphere. Diesel exhaust has been classified by EPA as a likely human carcinogen.
                            EPA recognizes that these emissions from marine diesel engines contribute to ozone and
                            carbon monoxide nonattainment (i.e, failure to meet air quality standards), as well as
                            adverse health effects associated with ambient concentrations of particulate matter and
                            visibility, haze, acid deposition, and eutrophication and nitrification of water. EPA
                            estimates that large marine diesel engines accounted for about 1.6 percent of mobile
                            source nitrogen oxide emissions and 2.8 percent of mobile source particulate emissions
                            in the United States in 2000. Contributions of marine diesel engines can be higher on a
                            port-specific basis. Ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) is a standard for defining diesel fuel
                            with substantially lowered sulfur contents. As of 2006, almost all of the petroleum-based
                            diesel fuel available in Europe and North America is of a ULSD type.</span>.

                                A boom in shipping is aggravating air pollution in China and other nations in east Asia, causing thousands of deaths a year in a region with eight of the world’s 10 biggest container ports, scientists have said.
                                Ship traffic, often overlooked compared to cars and factories that are far bigger causes of smog, has more than doubled off east Asia since 2005 and some pollution from the fuel oil of ships wafts inland, scientists said on Monday.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                On July 25, a Japanese ship named MV Wakashio struck a coral reef on southeast coast of Mauritius. The vessel carrying 4000 tonnes of crude oil started leaking into the Indian Ocean. More than 1000 tonnes of oil leaked from the cracked vessel polluting the coral reefs, beaches and lagoons of the island nation.The government also sought international help to contain the damage and compensate for the lossses.

                            <p>
                                The use of technology to help map and predict impacts of future spills has proliferated. Several data-driven models have been developed to predict the environmental and economic effects of spills. Models differ, but they all consider the chemical and physical characteristics of spilled substances and geographic location of a spill as well as
                                evaluate the climatic, atmospheric, and ocean circulation data to project the spread of a spill. These models are aided by hyperspectral imaging satellites which allow for detailed identification and tracking of spills. Sensitive satellite imaging can differentiate between different grades of oil, even in small concentrations. Satellites are also being used in Canada, USA, and France to monitor illegal discharges of oil. IMO has recently started including environmental risk evaluation as an official criterion in their Formal Safety Assessment policy tool, which historically has focused solely on economic costs of mitigating environmental damage.

                            <p class="flip">
                                Oceans have always been noisy environments due to natural ambient underwater noise from waves, vocalizations from marine mammals, and other marine species. Underwater ocean ambient noise levels have increased by ~ 15 dB in the past 50 years due to increased marine transportation, resource extraction, fishing, recreational activities, and other anthropogenic sources. Man-made noise differs from ambient underwater noise with respect to direction, frequency, and duration. Underwater noise has become increasingly important due to the nature of sound propagation traveling approximately five times faster in water than air and the wide range of detrimental effects to marine species. Until recently, the focus was aimed at marine mammals, but it is now acknowledged that underwater noise can significantly impact fish and other marine organisms. Commercial shipping is the source of low frequency, (i.e., 5–500 Hz), background noise in the world’s oceans. Underwater noise pollution can significantly impact marine life even over long distances. Impacts of underwater noise depend on duration and intensity. For example, the effects of long-term low-intensity noise, from marine vessels, can have greater negative effects on species than short-term large bursts of noise, such as underwater explosions

                            <p>
                                Regulation of ballast water began in 1989 when Canada introduced guidelines for the management of ballast water for ships traveling to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway (Transport Canada, 2010). Ballast water in Canada is now managed by the Ballast Water Control and Management Regulations. Canada’s ballast water regulations require all ships entering the country to exchange their ballast water outside the EEZ in
                                water 2000 m deep (i.e., mid-ocean exchange [MOE]). Exceptions exist in the case of safety reasons (high seas, storms), where an alternate ballast water exchange location is acceptable. Moreover, ships used for search and rescue operations or pleasure craft, < 50 m length and have a maximum ballast water capacity of 8 m3, are exempt from ballast water regulations (Transport Canada, 2010). MOE is the most common method of treating ballast water. The exchange of port ballast water in the open ocean is thought to eliminate species residing in the ballast by exposing them to different salinity, thereby causing mortality due to osmosis. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="solution">

                                            <p class="flip">
                                                Air pollutants can be reduced by integrating new technologies, operational controls, and market-based strategies. Replacing old engine systems, switching to low-sulfur fuels, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR), an exhaust cleaning method, are proven to improve environmental performance of marine vessels.
                                                Sulphur has been removed from fuel used in cars for decades now, but the consumption of cheap unpurified fuels has made maritime transport the worst producer of sulphur emissions. Sulphur can be removed with a sulphur scrubber or clearing the fuel from sulfur impurities. Both options are expensive. The sulphur content of fuels was globally limited to 0.5% starting from 2020.
                                                To increase the fuel efficiency of ship engines, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has developed a tool called the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which defines efficiency values for new ships. EEDI is calculated for each new ship in the designing phase. It depicts the relationship between the amount of fuel consumed by the ship and the amount of cargo transported.
