                    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                    <p>
                        From centuries past, the sea has always been important to all and shipping plays
                        a crucial role being the backbone of world trade and economy. Underlying this is
                        the fact that 95% of the country international trade is carried in whole or in part
                        by maritime transport.
                        Though the ocean shipping industry, which transports 90 percent of what we own,
                        contributes approximately 3 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change,
                        sea and land acidification, and poor air quality. The industry also affects the oceansâ€™ environmental health
                        through chemical cargo residues, cleaning agents, and nonindigenous species from ballast water.

                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
                        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
                        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
                        the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                        passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
                        from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
                        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45
                        BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem
                        ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The
                        standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
                        below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
                        Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their
                        exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914
                        translation by H. Rackham.Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum

                                From centuries past, the sea has always been important to all and shipping plays
                                a crucial role being the backbone of world trade and economy. Underlying this is
                                the fact that 95% of the country international trade is carried in whole or in part
                                by maritime transport.
                                Though the ocean shipping industry, which transports 90 percent of what we own,
                                contributes approximately 3 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change,
                                sea and land acidification, and poor air quality. The industry also affects the oceansâ€™ environmental health
                                through chemical cargo residues, cleaning agents, and nonindigenous species from ballast water.
